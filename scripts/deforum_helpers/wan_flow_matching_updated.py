DEPRECATED: This file has been replaced by wan_flow_matching.py

This file contained an incomplete or older version of the Wan Flow Matching implementation.
Please use wan_flow_matching.py instead, which contains the simplified and current implementation.

The new implementation:
- Uses "Wan" instead of "WAN" for naming consistency
- Simplified architecture without complex tensor adapters
- Direct integration with official Wan repository
- Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead

This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
