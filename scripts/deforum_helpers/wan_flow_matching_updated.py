NEXT STEPS:
1. The tensor adapter successfully identified this as a DiT/Flux model

3. This indicates the source model architecture is different than expected

The tensor adapter needs refinement for this specific model variant.

TENSOR ADAPTER STATUS:
The tensor adapter successfully identified the model as DiT/Flux (not WAN) and converted tensors.
This is a significant improvement - the system now correctly handles non-WAN models.

Common remaining causes:
- Model architecture variations not yet supported by tensor adapter
- Complex tensor shape mismatches requiring advanced mapping
- WAN repository version compatibility issues
- GPU memory constraints
