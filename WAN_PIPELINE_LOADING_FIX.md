# WAN Pipeline Loading Fix

## Problem Summary

After fixing the KeyError issue, a new error occurred during WAN video generation:

```
RuntimeError: Wan pipeline not loaded
```

This error was happening when the system tried to generate frames but the WAN model pipeline hadn't been loaded yet.

## Root Cause

The issue was that the `generate_video_with_i2v_chaining()` method was **missing the model validation and pipeline loading logic** that exists in the `generate_video_simple()` method.

**Missing Steps**:
1. Model validation (`_validate_wan_model()`)
2. Pipeline loading (`load_simple_wan_pipeline()`)

## Error Location

**File**: `scripts/deforum_helpers/wan_simple_integration.py`  
**Function**: `generate_video_with_i2v_chaining()`  
**Issue**: Method tried to use `self.pipeline` before loading it

## Fix Applied

### Added Missing Pipeline Loading Logic

**Before** (missing validation and loading):
```python
def generate_video_with_i2v_chaining(self, clips, model_info, output_dir, ...):
    try:
        import shutil
        import os
        from datetime import datetime
        
        # Get the timestring from the output directory name or create one
        timestring = os.path.basename(output_dir).split('_')[-1]
        # ... rest of method without pipeline loading
```

**After** (with proper validation and loading):
```python
def generate_video_with_i2v_chaining(self, clips, model_info, output_dir, ...):
    try:
        import shutil
        import os
        from datetime import datetime
        
        print(f"üé¨ Starting I2V chained generation with {len(clips)} clips...")
        print(f"üìÅ Model: {model_info['name']} ({model_info['type']}, {model_info['size']})")
        
        # Validate model first
        if not self._validate_wan_model(model_info):
            raise RuntimeError("Wan model validation failed - missing required files")
        
        # Load the model if not loaded
        if not self.pipeline:
            print("üîß Loading Wan pipeline for I2V chaining...")
            if not self.load_simple_wan_pipeline(model_info):
                raise RuntimeError("Failed to load Wan pipeline")
        
        # Get the timestring from the output directory name or create one
        timestring = os.path.basename(output_dir).split('_')[-1]
        # ... rest of method
```

## Technical Details

### Pipeline Loading Flow

The fix ensures the following sequence:

1. **Model Validation**: Check that all required WAN model files exist
2. **Pipeline Loading**: Load the WAN model into memory if not already loaded
3. **Frame Generation**: Proceed with actual video generation

### Consistency with Existing Code

This fix makes `generate_video_with_i2v_chaining()` consistent with `generate_video_simple()`, which already had the proper loading logic.

## Expected Results

After this fix:

1. ‚úÖ **Model Validation**: WAN model files are checked before use
2. ‚úÖ **Pipeline Loading**: WAN model is properly loaded into memory
3. ‚úÖ **Frame Generation**: The system can proceed to actual frame generation
4. ‚úÖ **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback about model loading status

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/deforum_helpers/wan_simple_integration.py` - Added pipeline loading logic
2. `WAN_PIPELINE_LOADING_FIX.md` - This documentation (created)

## Progress Summary

With all three fixes now applied:

1. ‚úÖ **FFmpeg Video Stitching Fix**: Frame naming and FFmpeg command issues resolved
2. ‚úÖ **KeyError Fix**: Data structure mismatch between UI and WAN integration resolved  
3. ‚úÖ **Pipeline Loading Fix**: Missing model validation and loading logic added

The WAN video generation pipeline should now proceed to the actual model inference stage, where it will attempt to load and run the WAN model for frame generation.
