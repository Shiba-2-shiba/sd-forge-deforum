# Fluxabled Fork of the Deforum Stable Diffusion Extension for Forge

Experimental fork of the [Deforum extension](https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-forge-deforum)
for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge), 
fix'd up to work with Flux.1, integrate Parseq keyframe redistribution logic, and support **Wan 2.1 AI Video Generation**.
Integrates dynamic camera shake effects with data sourced from EatTheFutures 'Camera Shakify' Blender plugin.

## Current status

This fork of the extension is _basically working_.

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Configurations that use the **experimental render core** by enabling the 
new keyframe distribution feature, may require that some unsupported features are being kept disabled.

## Requirements

### Get SD WebUI Forge
Install, update and run the 'one-click installation package' of
[Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge)
as described. Includes:
* Python 3.10.6
* CUDA 12.1
* Pytorch 2.3.1

Other versions _may_ work with this extension, but have not been properly tested.

### Run Flux on Forge

Get `flux1-dev-bnb-nf4-v2.safetensors` from huggingface and put it into your `<forge_install_dir>/models/Stable-diffusion/Flux`:
https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4/blob/main/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4-v2.safetensors

Get the following 3 files from huggingface and put them into `<forge_install_dir>/models/VAE`
* `ae.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/tree/main
* `clip_l.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main
* `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors` https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main

Restart Forge, set mode to "flux", select the flux checkpoint and all the 3 VAEs in "VAE / Text Encoder" and test with Txt2Img.

## Installation

### Directly in Forge (recommended)

Go to tab "Extensions" - "Install from URL" and use this: https://github.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum.git

### From the commandline

Open commandline and run `<forge_install_dir>/venv/Scripts/activate.bat` 
to activate the virtual environment (venv) for Python used by Forge.

With the venv from Forge activated, do:
```
cd <forge_install_dir>/extensions
git clone https://github.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum
cd sd-forge-deforum
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Update Deforum Settings

Get the latest default-settings.txt and place it directly into your 'webui' directory, then click "Load All Settings":
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum/main/scripts/default_settings.txt
Rename it to `deforum_settings.txt` (or whatever matches the name of your settings file in the UI) and put it directly into your 'webui' directory.

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Some Settings are currently not properly loaded or are not persisted 
in `default_settings.txt` and may need to be set manually the first time:
* Tab "Prompts" - "Prompts negative" not resetting
  * Consider removing the defaults because they're not used with Flux.

Recommendation: **Use ForgeUIs "Settings" - "Defaults" to save your settings.**

## Wan 2.1 AI Video Generation ‚ú®

### **Precision Text-to-Video with Deforum Integration**

The extension includes **Wan 2.1** (Alibaba's state-of-the-art video generation model) fully integrated with Deforum's scheduling system for frame-perfect video creation.

#### üéØ **Deforum Integration Features**
- **Prompt Scheduling**: Uses Deforum's prompt system for precise clip timing
- **FPS Integration**: Single FPS setting controls both Deforum and Wan
- **Seed Scheduling**: Optional seed control from Keyframes ‚Üí Seed & SubSeed tab
- **Strength Scheduling**: I2V chaining with continuity control from Keyframes ‚Üí Strength tab
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds Wan models without manual configuration

#### üöÄ **Quick Setup**

1. **Download Wan Models** (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Recommended: VACE 1.3B model (8GB+ VRAM) - All-in-one T2V+I2V
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-VACE-1.3B --local-dir models/wan
   
   # High Quality: VACE 14B model (16GB+ VRAM) - All-in-one T2V+I2V
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-VACE-14B --local-dir models/wan
   
   # Alternative: Separate T2V models (no I2V chaining)
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --local-dir models/wan
   
   # Legacy: Separate I2V models (for compatibility with older setups)
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-1.3B --local-dir models/wan
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B --local-dir models/wan
   ```

2. **Configure in Deforum**:
   - Set prompts in **Prompts tab** with frame numbers
   - Set FPS in **Output tab**
   - Go to **Wan Video tab** and click **"Generate Wan Video"**

#### üé¨ **VACE Models - Recommended for Seamless Video Generation**

**VACE (Video Adaptive Conditional Enhancement)** models are Wan's latest all-in-one architecture that handles both Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video generation with a single model, providing superior consistency for I2V chaining:

- **üîÑ Unified Architecture**: Single model handles both T2V and I2V generation
- **üéØ Perfect Consistency**: Same model ensures visual continuity between clips
- **‚ö° Efficient Memory**: No need to load separate T2V and I2V models
- **üé® Enhanced Quality**: Latest architecture with improved video generation

#### üé¨ **Deforum Workflow Example**

```json
{
  "0": "A serene mountain landscape at dawn",
  "30": "Morning mist rising from the valleys", 
  "60": "Golden sunlight breaking through clouds",
  "90": "Full daylight illuminating the peaks"
}
```

At 30 FPS, this creates exactly 1-second clips with seamless I2V transitions using VACE's unified architecture.

#### üìä **Model Comparison**
| Model | Type | Size | VRAM | Speed | Quality | I2V Chaining | Best For |
|-------|------|------|------|--------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **VACE-1.3B** | All-in-one | ~17GB | 8GB+ | Fast | Good | ‚úÖ Perfect | Most Users ‚≠ê |
| **VACE-14B** | All-in-one | ~75GB | 16GB+ | Slow | Excellent | ‚úÖ Perfect | High-end Systems |
| **T2V-1.3B** | T2V Only | ~17GB | 8GB+ | Fast | Good | ‚ùå None | Independent Clips |
| **T2V-14B** | T2V Only | ~75GB | 16GB+ | Slow | Excellent | ‚ùå None | Independent Clips |
| **I2V-1.3B** | I2V Only | ~17GB | 8GB+ | Fast | Good | ‚úÖ Good | Legacy I2V Chaining |
| **I2V-14B** | I2V Only | ~75GB | 16GB+ | Slow | Excellent | ‚úÖ Good | Legacy I2V Chaining |

**üí° Recommendation**: Use VACE models for I2V chaining workflows, T2V models only for independent clip generation.

#### üìö **Documentation**

For comprehensive documentation, see:
- **[Wan User Guide](docs/wan/README.md)** - Complete setup and usage guide
- **[Technical Reference](docs/wan/TECHNICAL.md)** - Developer documentation

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Features**
- **I2V Chaining**: Seamless transitions between clips using last frame as starting image
- **Continuity Control**: Strength override for maximum clip-to-clip continuity
- **4n+1 Frame Calculation**: Automatic handling of Wan's frame requirements
- **Flash Attention Fallback**: Works with or without flash-attn
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient VRAM usage for large generations
- **VACE T2V Mode**: Uses blank frame transformation for pure text-to-video generation

## Default Bunny Testrun

After installation, you can test the setup by generating the default bunny with
"Distribution" set to "Keyframes Only" and "Animation Mode" set to "3D".
This also downloads Depth-Anything V2 or the MiDaS model for depth warping when ran for the first time
and demonstrates prompt synchronization in a no-cadence setup.

The default bunnies contain 333 frames at 720p, but only 19 of them are actually diffused.
The diffused frames are placed in the clip according to the keyframes defined in the prompts.
The prompts themselves are aligned to be synchronized at 60 FPS with the beat of an 
amen break you can find linked in the settings (enable sound):

If you used other versions of the Deforum plugin before, it may also be necessary
to update or adjust your Deforum settings. The latest example settings with for the default bunny can also be downloaded here:

## What should work, what doesn't and what's untested

### Should work:

#### Wan 2.1 Video Generation
* **Text-to-Video**: High-quality AI video generation with precise frame timing
* **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic model detection and validation
* **Flash Attention Fallback**: Compatible with systems without flash-attn
* **Audio Synchronization**: Frame-perfect timing for music videos
* **Multiple Resolutions**: Support for various output sizes

#### Keyframe Distribution
Causes the rendering to run on an experimental core that can rearrange keyframes,
which makes it possible to set up fast generations with less jitter at high or no cadence.

##### New sub-tab under "Keyframes"
* Can now be used **with- or without- Parseq**.
* Allows for precise sync at high cadence.
* Detailed info and recommendations on new tab.

#### Asynchronous Subtitle generation
All subtitles are now generated and written to an .srt file in advance.
Complex subtitle generations should work fine with Parseq but are currently limited with Deforum-only setups.
* New Deforum setting for skipping the prompt-part to a new line in .srt files.
* New Deforum setting for choosing simple (non-technical) subtitles that contain only the text from the prompt.
  * Complex subtitles should work fine when Parseq is used, but are otherwise limited to essential information only.
  * Recommendation: turn on for now if not using Parseq
* Removed emtpy "--neg" param from being written into the subtitles
  because negative prompts are ignored in Flux workflows.
* Improved padding of technical information so subtitles jitter less.

### Camera Shakify Effects

Add camera shake effects to your renders on top of your other movement.

##### New sub-sub-tab under "Keyframes"

This feature enhances the realism of your animations by simulating natural camera movements, adding a layer of depth
and engagement to your visuals. Perfect for creating action sequences or adding a sense of spontaneity, 
it allows for customizable shake parameters to fit your specific needs.

The shake data is available under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license and was sourced from the
['Camera Shakify' Blender plugin by EatTheFuture](https://github.com/EatTheFuture/camera_shakify).

### Perhaps working (untested)
* Flux schnell
  * There's not a lot of precision for fine-tuning strength values when only 4 steps are required.
* Control Net
* Hybrid Video
* Non-Flux workflows

### Currently not working with experimental core
* Kohya HR Fix
  * may need to be left disabled
* FreeU
  * may need to be left disabled
* Control Net

### Other Stuff
* Includes a new default setup to generate default bunny at 60 FPS in 720p with keyframes only.
* Non-essential emojis can be turned off with a checkbox under "Settings" - "Deforum".
* Seed and Subseed tabs unified.

## Troubleshooting

### Wan 2.1 Issues
* **No models found**: Download Wan models using the commands above
* **Generation fails**: Try the 1.3B model if using 14B, check VRAM usage
* **Flash attention errors**: Compatibility layer should handle this automatically
* **Audio sync problems**: Verify frame numbers in prompt schedule match your timing needs

### Settings file
During active development, content and structure of the `deforum_settings.txt` file 
can change quickly been updated. Settings from older versions may not behave as expected.
If necessary, the latest deforum-settings.txt are available for download here:
https://github.com/Tok/sd-forge-deforum/blob/main/scripts/default_settings.txt

### General Issues
* **Import errors**: Restart WebUI after installation
* **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **Performance issues**: Check VRAM usage and reduce settings
