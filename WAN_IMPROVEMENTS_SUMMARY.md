# Wan 2.1 Integration Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Wan 2.1 integration in Deforum to address frame extraction, I2V chaining, model hookup, and inference steps configuration.

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. Frame Extraction to PNG ✅
**Issue**: Frames were not being extracted as individual PNG files.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `_save_frames_as_pngs()` method with improved error handling
- Added support for multiple tensor formats (4D, 5D tensors)
- Proper handling of PIL Images, numpy arrays, and PyTorch tensors
- Automatic format conversion (grayscale to RGB, RGBA to RGB)
- Frame-by-frame PNG saving with progress tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/deforum_helpers/wan_simple_integration.py` (lines 673-793)

### 2. I2V (Image-to-Video) Chaining ✅
**Issue**: All clips except the first should use I2V and provide the last frame as input.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `generate_video_with_i2v_chaining()` method
- Enhanced `_generate_wan_i2v_frames()` with multiple I2V strategies:
  - Method 1: Dedicated I2V pipeline method
  - Method 2: Main pipeline with image conditioning
  - Method 3: Enhanced T2V with image-aware prompts
- Proper last frame extraction and passing between clips
- Fallback mechanisms for when I2V is not available

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/deforum_helpers/wan_simple_integration.py` (lines 811-1017)

### 3. Inference Steps Minimum ✅
**Issue**: Minimum inference steps was set to 20, needed to be 5.

**Status**: ✅ **Fixed - UI Override Applied**
- The minimum is correctly set to 5 in `scripts/deforum_helpers/args.py`
- Configuration: `"minimum": 5, "maximum": 100, "step": 5, "value": 50`
- **UI Fix Applied**: Added explicit override in `ui_elements.py` to force minimum to 5
- **Solution**: UI now explicitly copies config and sets `minimum = 5` to bypass any caching
- **Verification**: Restart WebUI and check Wan tab → Basic Wan Settings → Inference Steps slider

### 4. Wan Model Hookup ✅
**Issue**: Wan may not be hooked up correctly.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned `_create_custom_wan_pipeline()` with multiple loading strategies:
  - Strategy 1: Official Wan repository integration
  - Strategy 2: Diffusers-based loading
  - ~~Strategy 3: Procedural fallback generation~~ **REMOVED**
- **FAIL-FAST APPROACH**: No fallbacks - system fails with descriptive errors when Wan isn't available
- Added proper model validation and error handling
- Enhanced pipeline initialization with T2V and I2V model support
- Improved device management and memory handling
- Comprehensive setup instructions in error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/deforum_helpers/wan_simple_integration.py` (lines 83-241)

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed error messages
- **FAIL-FAST BEHAVIOR**: No fallbacks, descriptive errors with setup instructions
- Added stack trace printing for debugging
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guides in error messages

### Better Frame Discarding Logic
- Improved `_calculate_frame_discarding()` to discard from middle instead of end
- Preserves start and end frames for better visual continuity
- Ensures exact frame count matching

### Improved Model Loading
- Multiple loading strategies with **NO FALLBACKS**
- Support for both official Wan repository and diffusers format
- **REMOVED**: Procedural generation fallback
- **FAIL-FAST**: Descriptive errors when models aren't available
- Better path management and dependency handling

### Enhanced I2V Implementation
- Multiple I2V approaches for maximum compatibility
- Proper image preprocessing and resizing
- Enhanced prompts for better continuity when I2V isn't available
- Seed management for reproducible results
- **FAIL-FAST**: Clear errors when I2V models aren't available

```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_wan_improvements.py`) has been created to verify:

1. ✅ Wan integration import
2. ✅ Model discovery functionality  
3. ✅ Pipeline loading with multiple strategies
4. ✅ PNG frame generation and extraction
5. ✅ I2V chaining between clips
6. ✅ Inference steps minimum configuration
7. ✅ Deforum integration hookup

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Download Wan models: `huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --local-dir models/wan`
2. Set animation mode to "Wan Video" in Deforum
3. Configure prompts in the Prompts tab
4. Set inference steps (minimum 5, recommended 20-50)
5. Generate video - PNG frames will be automatically extracted and I2V chaining will be used

### For Developers:
1. Run the test script: `python test_wan_improvements.py`
2. Check the generated PNG frames in `test_output/wan_improvements/wan_frames/`
3. Verify I2V chaining by checking clip-specific directories
4. Monitor console output for detailed generation progress

## Key Features

### PNG Frame Extraction
- ✅ Automatic PNG frame saving during generation
- ✅ Proper format conversion and error handling
- ✅ Frame numbering and organization
- ✅ Progress tracking and logging

### I2V Chaining
- ✅ First clip uses T2V (Text-to-Video)
- ✅ Subsequent clips use I2V with last frame from previous clip
- ✅ Multiple I2V implementation strategies
- ✅ Enhanced T2V fallback when I2V unavailable (within real Wan models only)

### Model Integration
- ✅ Auto-discovery of Wan models
- ✅ Multiple loading strategies with **NO FALLBACKS**
- ✅ Support for both 1.3B and 14B models

## Compatibility

The improvements maintain backward compatibility while enforcing real Wan usage:
- Existing Wan configurations continue to work **IF** properly set up
- **NO FALLBACKS**: System fails fast with descriptive errors when Wan isn't available

- **REMOVED**: Procedural generation fallbacks

## Setup Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Wan now requires proper setup - no fallbacks available!

### Required Setup Steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1.git
   ```

2. **Install Wan dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd Wan2.1
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install Flash Attention (required):**
   ```bash
   pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
   ```

4. **Download Wan models:**
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --local-dir models/wan
